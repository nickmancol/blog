Summary: I am coursing a Master degree in Data Science, here some info about the incentives, the program and the whole experience.

I know that many many people think that formal education is overrated, useless and in some edge cases just plain wrong. But i have started since August 2017 a [Master degree in Data Science for Complex Economic Systems](http://madas.carloalberto.org) and would like to express my motivations, experiences and finally, answer a common question, do i recommend it?.


## Incentives

I always loved to study, my mom taught me how to read and count when i was very young, my father had the great idea to buy month by month an [encyclopedia](https://www.amazon.com/Vox%C2%AD%C2%ADLexis%C2%AD22-Diccionario-Enciclopedia-23-vols/dp/0828855544) since he knew that my elder sister was on her way (1979), school was not cool but the feeling of learning was amazing, one of my dreams is to push the human knowledge a little bit forward, at my bachelor i performed badly but i enjoyed and learned valuable lessons with a _little help of my friends_, as a counterpart my studying habits became worst and procrastination was a rule and not an exception.

Colombia is a stratified society, the concept of Social Mobility its usually associated with getting more money and _have_ more stuff, but for me, it was in another way, the lesson from my family was something like "lookup for __knowledge mobility__ in order to become a better citizen", my bachelor degree as Systems Engineer was a huge step in that direction but i didn't realize it at that time.

__A note about Engineering__

I prefer to think about me as a Data Engineer (ingeniero) using the etymology described by [Rodriguez and Velez](https://juliangiraldo.files.wordpress.com/2007/05/etimologia-del-termino-ingeniero.pdf) which links Engineering with Philosophy and Science.

__End of note__

At Universidad Nacional de Colombia i got a great course called __"General Systems Theory"__ -[this is the 90's web page](http://disi.unal.edu.co/~lctorress/tgs/tgs001.htm) you can find the lectures and excercises- which introduced the concepts of Complexity, Systems, Creativity, Turing machines, Algorithms and others, in that time it sound like a beautiful way of thinking but i couldn't find a way to apply it, i was eager to go outside and _just_ programming -spoiler: Big mistake-.

In other courses i have some __graph theory__ and a little bit of __data structures__, when i discovered the RDF standard in the early 2000's i got really excited about the posibilities of the technology, but again, i got no incentives to apply it and just leave it as another _someday oneday_ dream.

Fast forward to 2013 when [Henry](https://twitter.com/tufla) and i were trying to improve the world with [Oppten](http://nicolasbohorquez.netlify.com/projects/past/#oppten) -we used some machine learning algorithms to __classify publica data__- but failed. Some degree of responsability was on the lack of basic skills that a data engineer should have: statistics, modeling, scientific approach.

In 2016 [W](https://tiempofueraw.wordpress.com/acerca-de/) and i decided that our next endeavour should be a qualitative and quantitative leap for the future of our family. And we choose education over entrepreneurship and crude financial investement. As part of our vision to live close to our dreams we selected a Master degree for myself that would let us:

- Live abroad
- Learn a new language (Italian / Python / R)
- Improve my hard / soft skills in my profession (software developer / entrepreneur)

So, after some research and some sacrificies i got enrolled in the only Master program that combines elements on [Complexity, Graphs / Data structures and Data Science](http://madas.carloalberto.org) (August 2017). I think that it has the right amount of buzz words, statistics, academic 	strictness and knowledge awesomeness that i was looking for. Also we were aware of the common critiques about formal studies -[1](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-i-left-my-masters-program-charles-pensig-1),[2](https://blog.stitchdata.com/5-things-you-should-know-before-getting-a-degree-in-data-science-40cddf44aac3),[3](https://www.forbes.com/sites/metabrown/2016/07/29/4-reasons-not-to-get-that-masters-in-data-science/#2bd3afed40c0) among others-, but this program just fit perfectly in all my personal criteria and W was also excited about the posibilities that it would open to us as a family, finally we know that few investments yield as high a return as a college degree -[1](https://www.brookings.edu/research/thirteen-economic-facts-about-social-mobility-and-the-role-of-education/),[2](https://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/social-mobility-and-education),[3](https://blogs.worldbank.org/futuredevelopment/how-can-we-reduce-high-income-inequality)-.

## Experience

The master is taught by Collegio Carlo Alberto in Turin, Piemonte, Italy. Of course you will understand the advantages of visit Italy, if not check [this](http://www.italia.it/en/home.html), but also check the course program of the Master in the first semester:

- CODING IN R
- CODING IN PYTHON
- STATISTICS IN R
- ECONOMICS OF COMPLEX SYSTEMS
- NETWORK ANALYSIS
- AGENT BASED MODELING I
- AGENT BASED MODELING II
- DATA SCIENCE
- MACHINE LEARNING

which is basically an intro for programming, basic statistics, Agent Based Modeling and the theoretical foundations for Network Analysis. The target for this Master is a fresh graduate student from Economics or Statistics. Outsiders like Engineers might have a little advantage in the coding courses but i will recommend to take previously some Data Science courses from MOOC platforms if you want to enhance the experience. You can get a detailed description of each course [here](http://www.madas.carloalberto.org/course-program/).

### The good

The approach to Heterodox Economics is great, it has refreshed my opinion about the whole science, the interaction with amazing people from my program and the others offered by the Collegio is, by far, the best gain so far. The last time that i took a formal academic course was 12 years ago and now i remember how difficult was for me, but also how gratifying could be when you suddenly realize something new and unexpected, i would describe it as a small _[Satori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satori)_.

### The bad

It is a new program, many things are not yet polished and would feel like the mainstream of the Economics theory should have been taught as an introductory course. Also the dilemma of R / Python / NetLogo doesn't help to get the idea of the forest over the trees. Some courses with high potential to give you a wider view of the use of technology across industries are dismissed by some students, they just want to apply techniques or even worst, just the certificate.

### The ugly

I think that we get lost in translation many times, also the Italian bureucracy is an important factor. I would say that for the non EU citizens the impedance of the arrival could be lowered with clear processes

## Shall you try?

It's going to be a long way for Collegio Carlo Alberto to win the race over Berkeley or Coursera, but they have advantages and a novel approach that i think it's worth to try.

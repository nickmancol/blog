I know that many many people think that formal education is overrated, useless and in some edge cases just plain wrong. But i have started since August 2017 a [Master degree in Data Science for Complex Economic Systems](http://madas.carloalberto.org) and would like to express my motivations, experiences and finally, answer a common question, do i recommend it?.

Summary: Why a new blog?
Status: published

This new Blog is a on-going story, it's an attempt to -as Americans would say- _put my money where my mouth is_. Since some time ago (+3yrs) i have expressed in public that i am trying to live by the _show don't tell_ principle, and in general i think that in many cases -at least in Latin America- our acts are way behind our discourse, the _fake it before you make it_ antipattern seems to be highly encouraged in many industries and cultures, even personal ones. This blog is one step to close that gap from my side.

I like to think this endeavour as my humble attempt to stand at the shore of the cosmic ocean (thank you Carl Sagan!), since 2012 i have been exploring the way to improve the world using data, and at the same time expanding my universe with new adventures and experiences outside of my comfort bubble. Now, 5 years later i think that the experience has been more than positive and with a more solid understanding of myself, my environment, my goals and dreams i finally can take a step further in the direction to reach a bigger ocean.

I cannot say enough about the benefits of having a partner in this kind of adventures, in my case my beautiful wife  [W](https://tiempofuera.wordpress.com) has been more than supportive and now, with my little MathVader, i have more incentives to learn and show him that we can be cosmopolitans - _citizens of the universe_ -, and that the software is the best way to improve the world.

Finally, from a more technical perspective i have choosen [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) as static site generator (with markdown as markup syntax), [Github](https://github.com) to store the content and [Netlify](https://netlify.com) as platform to deploy the content. I use [Atom](https://atom.io) as editor. The main reason to change from wordpress is privacy, second, i want to test some code with this project (see [Building a private comment system](/code/private-blog-comments.html) for blogs and [Building a private web analytics](/code/private-blog-analytics.html) for blogs), and third, i want to use my current [favorite technical stack](/code/technical-stack-current.html) in many contexts.

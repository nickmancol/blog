This new Blog is a on-going story, it's an attempt to -as Americans would say- _put my money where my mouth is_. Since some time ago (+3yrs) i have expressed in public that i am trying to live by the _show don't tell_ principle, and in general i think that in many cases -at least in Latin America- our acts are way behind our discourse, the _fake it before you make it_ antipattern seems to be highly encouraged in many industries and cultures, even personal ones. This blog is one step to close that gap from my side.

I like to think this endeavour as my humble attempt to stand at the shore of the cosmic ocean (thank you Carl Sagan!), since 2012 i have been exploring the way to improve the world using data, and at the same time expanding my universe with new adventures and experiences outside of my comfort bubble. Now, 5 years later i think that the experience has been more than positive and with a more solid understanding of myself, my environment, my goals and dreams i finally can take a step further in the direction to reach a bigger ocean.

I cannot say enough about the benefits of having a partner in this kind of adventures, in my case my beautiful wife  [W](https://tiempofuera.wordpress.com) has been more than supportive and now, with my little MathVader, i have more incentives to learn and show him that we can be cosmopolitans - _citizens of the universe_ -, and that the software is the best way to improve the world.

Title: About me
Authors: Nicolás Bohórquez
Status: published

I am Data Engineer (Ingeniero de Datos) because i like to use my wit (Ingenio) to solve problems using data, my education reflects this approach and have reinforced my idea that software is the best way to improve the world. Many of my projects and products had a positive impact in many people and -despite many errors- i think that my cycle as entrepreneur has been really successful. I love to try tools, build things and explain concepts. You can checkout my resume and past experience at my [personal website](http://nicolasbohorquez.netlify.com/).

This blog is only a personal point of view that doesn't reflect the opinions of my colleagues, family or employers.
